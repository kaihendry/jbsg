# Singapore API key

Jump hoops by going to <https://www.nea.gov.sg/api> to register for an API.

Then populate `.creds.ini` with that 48 character long key:

key=FOOBARBB6606AD0308169EFFAA82311AFE51365CC7530A

The app would be a lot simpler and a lot less frustrating if it [didn't
require a key to disallow a simple static client side Javascript
app](http://dabase.com/blog/Javascript_API_barriers/). Also XML is an abomination. Please use JSON.
